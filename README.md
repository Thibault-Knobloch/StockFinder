# StockFinder
Website to filter through stocks. The goal is to help beginner investors find companies to start researching and getting started in the financial markets.
This is my first attempt to web-development! It uses the yahoo finance API. This website is also the world-record holder for the slowest requests and can only filter by stock price or market cap (or combination)... but will hopefully become better soon!
