# StockFinder
Website to filter through stocks. The goal is to help beginner investors find companies to start researching and getting started in the financial markets.
It is my first attempt at web-development (I am using the django framework). It connects to the yahoo-finance API. This website is also the world-record holder for the slowest requests and can (for now) only filter by stock price and market cap (or combination).
Will hopefully get better and more complete soon!

You can find the main code under stockfinder/main (most important is views.py and forms.py). The html file is in the templates folder.
